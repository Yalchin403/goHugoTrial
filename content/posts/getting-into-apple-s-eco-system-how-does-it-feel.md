Well, I'm not in the eco-system fully yet tho, but I do feel its power already. Till this point, to be honest, I heard a lot of things about apple, iPhone, and Macbooks. I mean bad and good things. After buying my first iPhone, I already explained why I decided to buy it in the previous blog, I was thinking about getting a new laptop and my target was an Asus zenbook. Again there were some reasons for this choice too.

1. It was thin and light enough to carry.

   As a programmer and also a master's degree student, I feel urgent to carry my laptop with me all day. And carrying 15.6 inches laptop with me (which had additional ram and SSD storage mounted internally) was a pain in the ass tbh. So I decided to pick up something really powerful and also light enough to carry.
2. It was a touch screen and also foldable and used as a tablet.

   I was thinking if I buy it, I can basically use it as a tablet too.
3. It was in a moderate price.

So all in all, it was for my needs, unless I started to think about getting MacBook which was around twice as much as an Asus zenbook. Then I found out apple's eco-system. Which means I can kind of use my iPhone together with my MacBook in a synchronized way. I researched those things and I found out a lot of points on that. Bascially I would be able to control my iPhone, accepting calls and replying messages with my MacBook and one of the best features: Airdrop.
