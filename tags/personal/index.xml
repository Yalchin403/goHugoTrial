I usually write those blogs not because I&amp;rsquo;m expert at them, but I write them, first, as a reference and second, as contribution to the growing programming society. Anyway, I was planning to write this post about my switch from Android (have been using it since I got my first phone) to IOS, but then I thought I might include some personal details as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
