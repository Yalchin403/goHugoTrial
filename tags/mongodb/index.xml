Recently I have got an job offer as Python/Flask developer in one of the local companies in my country. They are using Mongodb as their production database. They requested a little bit of task to accomplish before we move on to HR interview. So the task was about coding autocomplete search logic and also finding the closest location to our current location from the database.</description></item></channel></rss>
