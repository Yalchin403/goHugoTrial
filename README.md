# blog.yalchin.ml

I recently discovered GoHugo static website generated, so I got excited about it. Just wanted to create a simple static blog and configure CI/CD for deployment. 

I wasted significant amount of time as I ignored doc for short time I messed up the project a bit in the blink of an eye. But later I found the problem and fixed. As I already have the blog & portfolio website (https://yalchin.info), I don't plan to use this blog for technical stuff, but definitely it seems very attractive and usable.
