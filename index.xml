I usually write those blogs not because I&amp;rsquo;m expert at them, but I write them, first, as a reference and second, as contribution to the growing programming society. Anyway, I was planning to write this post about my switch from Android (have been using it since I got my first phone) to IOS, but then I thought I might include some personal details as well.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/personal/contact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 02:30:25 +0400</pubDate><guid>/personal/contact/</guid><description>Phone := +994 70 501 9780 Email := yalchinmammadli@yalchin.info Telegram := @mrRootLog</description></item></channel></rss>
