main website where I mainly write mixed tech blogs to solve some problems. I usually write those blogs not because I&rsquo;m
expert at them, but I write them, first, as a reference and second, as contribution to the growing programming
society. Anyway, I was planning to write this post about my switch from Android (have been using it since I got my first
phone) to IOS, but then I thought I might include some personal details as well. So it&rsquo;s not gonna be
purely tech related.</p><h3 id=so-why-in-the-world-i-decided-to-switch-to-ios-or-iphone-as-main-device>So, why in the world, I decided to switch to IOS or Iphone as main device?</h3><p>Well, there are a number of reasons, I&rsquo;m not sure if you will take them as compelling reasons or not.
First, I was already decided that I need to replace my phone with the new one, as it was already using the previous one
around 4 years as of now. I was planning to pick up one of the flagship Android phones, but one thing changed my mind. <strong>THE SCREEN</strong>
So, any Android market currently popular in the market and considering it to be flagship has huge screen which is the thing
in the mobile phones that drives me crazy. I remember I made about one month of research before choosing my previous phone
and during that time I lived without phone, just because I didn&rsquo;t want to choose the wrong one. The only thing I forgot
pay attention while choosing it was its screen, it was perfectly made for my need but the screen&mldr; It&rsquo;s about 6.5" and
I always struggled to use it when I was using one of my hands. Apart from that it was perfect. The things I like about it:</p><ul><li>It had fast charging</li><li>About 4000 mAH (which was more than enough for me to use it full 1 day)</li><li>It&rsquo;s camera was okay for me as I&rsquo;m not selfie lover (I mostly use it to capture objects (normal objects :D))</li><li>Both 3.5 mm headphone jack and charging slot were mounted to the bottom of the screen (This makes it comfortable if</li><li>you want plug the power-bank in and also use your headphone and put your phone into your pocket upside down :D)</li><li>It&rsquo;s durability, hardware, and design was okay for me</li><li>It&rsquo;s os was Android, so I knew that customizing and using Google&rsquo;s ecosystem would not be a problem for me</li></ul><p>Another disadvantage of this phone was about #ROOT. I was not able to unlock the bootloader to #root the system as it
required me to provide a code which I need to get from the manufacturer. I first thought it&rsquo;s something good that is made
for security reasons unless I found out that manufacturer actually sells that code for about $60. I was like WTF (emotional damage).
Hence, I was reminding myself till now that whenever I need to buy new phone I need to consider things I considered at the time of buying my
previous phone and additionally consider it being compact and rootable if it&rsquo;s Android device.</p><p>Honestly, I researched a bit, but I was not able to find an Android phone which is compact, flagship, and also encompasses
criteria listed above. I found a lot of phones that was okay in terms of above but screen was main problem that I couldn&rsquo;t close my eyes on.</p><h3 id=prioritizing-screen-size>Prioritizing screen size</h3><p>Then I thought about getting an Iphone, SE (3rd gen) was first option, but I found it a bit low level as its battery
capacity was a bit low (around 2000 mAH) and also it was too compact than I wanted. Then I decided buying Iphone 11 with 6.1"
screen which was okay for me. Well, you prolly asking, okaaay, but what about the big list about, is that all satisfied
in Iphone 11? Well, the answer is definitely, <strong>no</strong>. And explanation is that I prioritized the screen and also thought
trying out Iphone and hopefully Apple eco system in the future.</p><h3 id=things-i-didnt-like-as-an-iphone-user>Things I didn&rsquo;t like as an Iphone user</h3><p>After switching to ios, I felt like I&rsquo;m missing a lot in terms
of customization that my Android phone had. Some apps are designed in a really stupid manner. Some examples include, calculator
app, clock app that I can&rsquo;t customize snooze time, Google Maps not being available for some countries (guess what? It&rsquo;s
not supported in Azerbaijan to, have we got surprised? Ofc, <strong>NO</strong>), I feel like settings is designed in a way that normal
users won&rsquo;t be able to find and customize most of the settings, I didn&rsquo;t like keyboard customization, it really disappointed
me not seeing comma in the main keyboard also being not able to add number row to the main keyboard, but keyboard accuracy seems
more accurate than my previous Android but still not perfect tbh. Another thing is about accessories that I need to buy additionally.
I needed to buy 20W fast charger as it was not provided in the box, lightening headphones or at least from lightening to 3.5
mm headphone jack switcher. Another really annoying thing is selectivity in iCloud uploads, especially photos.
I usually upload only camera rolls and ignore photos from certain apps. That&rsquo;s not the case, Apple is really curious about
all of your images and your &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; which is not in your hands in any way. Oh, one more crap, you can&rsquo;t use Amazon app in
Iphone, just because Iphone demanded Amazon to pay some proportion of their profit of an item which is bought by using Apple device.
I know it&rsquo;s absolute nonsense, but it is what it is.</p><h3 id=things-i-did-like-as-an-iphone-user>Things I did like as an Iphone user</h3><p>When it comes to some things that I liked, design seems really nice, hardware seems to be really
nice too, I don&rsquo;t feel or see any glitches or frozen screen or apps. Speaking of hardware, I really appreciate having a
manual slient mode switcher, it is really handy sometimes. The only thing that is bad about hardware is that repairment
will be really expensive in case I manage to break it somehow. Another advantage of getting an Iphone probably is long term
software update and above all, getting it at the same day with other Iphone users. That means that no matter which Iphone
model you use you won&rsquo;t need to wait for the update as we do with Androids. One thing that usually people complain about is that
even if a lot of new Iphone models appear in the market each and every year, we don&rsquo;t see a lot of difference between them, maybe
a little of design and screen size alterations. Honestly, I felt like this might be an advantage. Let me explain how&mldr;
At the moment I switch my phone after using it for years, I feel like there are a lot of differences between my old and new phone.
But with Iphone it would be different, it&rsquo;s like you buy a new one insert your sim card, transfer your data and continue
moving on.</p><h3 id=some-stereotypes-about-iphone>Some stereotypes about iPhone</h3><p>Some people say you won&rsquo;t be able to download and listen to music when you are offline. That&rsquo;s totally wrong, you can use
browsers like document browser or mozilla to download music or any other files. For music specifically you can use
<a href=https://t.me/mp3converteryoutubebot>this</a> sweet bot and listen music in your telegram app, forward, and save it easily.
You won&rsquo;t have any problem with file management in your iPhone too.</p><h3 id=why-im-planning-to-join-apples-ecosystem>Why I&rsquo;m planning to join Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem?</h3><p>Well, even though I didn&rsquo;t like iPhone in the past, I was always Mac fan, and was fascinated by its speed, power, and design.
Apart from that, I know that with synchronizing iPhone, everything will work flawlessly.</p><p>Another main point is that, with Mac, as a programmer, I can build mobile apps both for IOS and Android. Especially, considering
my post-graduate master&rsquo;s degree acceptance from Hungary in Mobile Development.</p><h3 id=how-im-going-to-overcome-disadvantages-listed-above>How I&rsquo;m going to overcome disadvantages listed above?</h3><p>Well, I researched some problems, solved some of them, but I need to live with some of them. Surprisingly, I&rsquo;m getting used to it.
Disturbing alarms, calculator, and unsupported apps like Google Maps (for political or economic reasons) are still of a problem.
But honestly, I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m missing something from the world just because I don&rsquo;t use Android. Each of them has its own
special advantages and well, people will decide based on their priorities like did with screen size.</p><p><strong>Thanks for reading!</strong></p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=/tags/personal/>Personal</a></span></p><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>(function(){var e=document,t=e.createElement("script");t.src="https://blog-yalchin-ml.disqus.com/embed.js",t.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(e.head||e.body).appendChild(t)})()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>1427 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2022-05-13 18:31</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=/posts/mongo_db_autocomplete/><span class=button__text>Accent and Case Insensitive Search and Minimum Distance Calculator in Pymongo</span>
